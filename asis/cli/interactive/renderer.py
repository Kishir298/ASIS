"""Terminal renderer: true streaming + legacy typing animation.

True streaming path: Ollama chunk -> provider -> engine -> ``on_chunk`` ->
``begin_stream/write_chunk/end_stream`` -> terminal without waiting for
completion. Legacy ``render()`` animates already-final text (kept for
voice turns, errors and non-streaming callers). The provider/engine never
knows about the terminal.
