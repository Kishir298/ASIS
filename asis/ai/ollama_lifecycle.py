"""
Ownership-safe Ollama server lifecycle for A.S.I.S.

A.S.I.S. is HTTP-only by default: when an Ollama server is already
running it connects and claims NO ownership (external servers are never
terminated). Only a process actually started by A.S.I.S. via
``ensure_ollama()`` becomes owned, and only that exact process handle
may be stopped by ``stop_owned_ollama()``.

Never kills by executable name (no ``taskkill /IM ollama.exe``,
no ``pkill ollama`` or equivalent).
